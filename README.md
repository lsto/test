## A Poem About Goats

```
In meadows green where wildflowers grow,
The goats dance high and goats dance low,
With horns that curve and eyes so bright,
They leap and bound from morn till night.

Upon the hills they climb with grace,
Each nimble hoof finds perfect place,
Their beards that sway in gentle breeze,
While munching grass beneath the trees.

Oh clever goats with minds so keen,
The wisest creatures I have seen,
They teach us joy in simple things,
And freedom that the mountain brings.

So here's to goats both far and near,
These gentle souls we hold so dear,
May their spirit wild and free,
Inspire all humanity.
