## A Poem About Goats

**The Mountain's Grace**

Upon the rocky cliffs they dance,  
With nimble hooves and fearless stance,  
The goats ascend where eagles soar,  
Through misted peaks and ancient lore.

Their bells ring out across the vale,  
A melody on mountain gale,  
With beards that sway and eyes so bright,  
They greet the dawn, embrace the night.

From verdant meadows to stone so steep,  
Where mortals fear to take a leap,  
These graceful climbers, sure and true,  
Paint landscapes with their morning dew.

Oh noble goat, with spirit free,  
You teach us what it means to be  
Unbounded by the fear of height,  
A beacon of pure mountain light.

*In pastures green and peaks so high,  
Beneath the vast and endless sky,  
The goats remind us every day  
That courage lights the upward way.*

*"The mountain goat teaches us that the steepest paths often lead to the most beautiful views."*
