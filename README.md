## A Poem About Goats

In meadows green where wildflowers grow,
The goats dance high and goats dance low,
With horns that curve and eyes so bright,
They leap with grace from morn till night.

Up rocky cliffs they nimbly bound,
Their hoofbeats make a rhythmic sound,
With beards that sway in mountain breeze,
They climb the heights with perfect ease.

The billy goat stands proud and tall,
The nanny tends her kids so small,
Together in their herd they stay,
Through seasons changing day by day.

When sunset paints the sky aglow,
These creatures that we've come to know,
Remind us of the simple joys,
That nature freely employs.

So here's to goats both wild and tame,
Who've earned their place in nature's game,
With spirit free and hearts so bold,
Their story's worth its weight in gold.
