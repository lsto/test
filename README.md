## A Poem About Goats

**The Mountain Climbers**

Upon the rocky cliffs they stand,  
With hooves so sure on stone and sand,  
The goats that dance where eagles soar,  
And leap across the mountain's floor.

Their beards wave wild in mountain breeze,  
As nimble as the dancing trees,  
With eyes that gleam like amber bright,  
They graze beneath the starry night.

From meadow green to summit high,  
They bound beneath the endless sky,  
These creatures bold, both wise and free,  
A sight of pure majesty.

The billy goat with horns held proud,  
The nanny gentle, not too loud,  
And little kids that hop and play,  
Throughout the golden mountain day.

So here's to goats, those climbers true,  
Who paint the hills in morning dew,  
With courage in their beating hearts,  
Where nature's grandest story starts.
